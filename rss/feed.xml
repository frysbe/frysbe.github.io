<p>Ghost is a pretty sweet blogging platform. But there are not many options for hosting yet. So why not use GitHub pages, a free and high performance platform for static hosting?</p>

<p>All you need is Ghostatic to convert your Ghost blog to a static site by a single click (or tap) on a button.</p>

<p>Ghostatic is open source and available under the same license as Ghost (MIT).</p>]]></description><link>http://frys.be/ghostatic/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">ee5d0aeb-7cd1-4b7d-bc99-4caa326c4434</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[frysbe]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2013 18:09:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[My First Post]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Hello, World!</p>]]></description><link>http://frys.be/my-first-post/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">34ec9c23-6a4f-4b9c-8c53-b379e6f0ffdb</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[frysbe]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2013 09:52:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome to Ghost]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>You're in! Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. Go ahead and edit this post to get going and learn how it all works!</p>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Writing in markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>formatting</em> shortcuts to style your content. For example, a list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Item number one</li>
<li>Item number two
<ul><li>A nested item</li></ul></li>
<li>A final item</li>
</ul>

<p>or with numbers!</p>

<ol>
<li>Remember to buy some milk  </li>
<li>Drink the milk  </li>
<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="links">Links</h3>

<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like <a href='http://ghost.org/' >http://ghost.org</a> - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to <a href='http://ghost.org/' >the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>

<h3 id="whataboutimages">What about Images?</h3>

<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>

<p><img src='http://tryghost.org/ghost.png'  alt="The Ghost Logo" /></p>

<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>

<h3 id="quoting">Quoting</h3>

<p>Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="workingwithcode">Working with Code</h3>

<p>Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>

<pre><code>.awesome-thing {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="readyforabreak">Ready for a Break?</h3>

<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="advancedusage">Advanced Usage</h3>

<p>There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can  write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.</p>

<p><input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!" /></p>

<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)</p>]]></description><link>http://frys.be/welcome-to-ghost/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">7b67e7b6-522f-46e7-af0c-ad8832729f32</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[frysbe]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2013 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
